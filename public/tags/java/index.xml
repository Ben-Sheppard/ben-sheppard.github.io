      <description>In the first blog post of the Apollo project, I suggested that I would be using Java for the project as it&amp;rsquo;s a familiar language to me, and as I would like to deepen my knowledge of Java, it feels like a good candidate. I am aware that there are likely more lightweight/faster/efficient languages/frameworks/tools to use but this time around at least its Java!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about all the possible things that I want to do with this project.</description>
