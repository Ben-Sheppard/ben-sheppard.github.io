Sometimes we often joke about the weather in the UK, mostly how its always raining. However, these past few weeks have been getting hotter and the greenhouses this week were over 30 degrees Celsius
sometimes you can only stand in there for about 5 minutes before you need some cool air! Anyway, onto the ramble...

## I've decided on the tone
Writing for me doesn't come natural,
I'm fine in instances where the topics are related to my work,
or when its just generally chatting to people, however, blog posts are a different beast.
So I've decided that I'm going to write these as if it were just you and me chatting! I think that will help me get into the flow of things.

## Brassicas
We've worked hard to protect the brassicas this year from a couple of different pests,
namely slugs and cabbage white butterflies.
This week we decided to alter the netting to allow more room for the taller purple sprouting brocolli to grow into.

## Sweetcorn
The sweetcorn has been a bit hit-and-miss this year,
we couldn't get any to germinate in the greenhouse, so we bought some plugs (shhh... I promise its not cheating haha).
Some plugs rooted well and carried on, but some didn't make it, so we had to replace them.

## Tomatoes
The tomatoes we left in the greenhouse were really getting to their limits,
the roots were starting to come out of the bottom of the pots!
We've potted up 20 of them so far and we've got 20 more to go,
not sure if I've mentioned it but we have 40 varieties growing - so we need to find a fair amount of space!
The aim is to get at least one fruit from each to have more seeds for our collection.

## Peas
Not sure about you, but our peas had a very bumpy and slow start,
once again, no idea why but its just one of those things.
They're catching up now, so we should have a good harvest in time.

## Beans
I think beans are one of my favourite plants to watch grow, they are quite bushy but when you get closer to them, you can see the beans forming.
They will take a little time though to mature enough to pick.

## A fun surprise!
We've been on the waiting list for a while now, but finally we've got to the top and have been allocated a second plot!
I feel like allotments are something that you either love and want to do more of, or you don't really continue them on.
As I've mentioned I share one with my father-in-law so we have each other to bounce ideas off and help out,
but sometimes we let ourselves get carried away with the ideas and the space we have!
The second plot (I'm calling it "plot two", I know, imaginative)
needed clearing and needs some work but it will allow us to grow more of the things we already have
(and some other fun things like asparagus).
I'm going to add a few pictures below that show how it was and how it currently is, but in time there will be more updates on this plot.
