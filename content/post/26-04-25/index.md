Sorry its been a while, over the last few weeks we've been busy at the allotment after the hibernation of winter.
To catch you up though, we've switched our second plot with one that is next to our first plot
(we call them plot one and plot two, inventive, I know!).

Anyway,
I'm going to get back into a routine of posting updates on the allotment
but bear with me because I'm still not the best at writing :D

## The plot
The plot is looking much better now,
the weather has been warm and sunny and the plants are starting to show,
I didn't get many full pictures of the plots today but here is one of plot 1 looking towards plot 2 in the background.

## Big greenhouse
The big greenhouse is very much full of seedlings, tomatoes, and some plants that are ready to go outside.
The tomatoes are doing ok,
they did sulk a little bit when I moved them from home to the greenhouse,
but I think they'll be fine in the long run (more below in the [Tomato](#tomatoes)) section.

## Brassicas
We spent some time this week working on the new (and huge)
brassica house that will be home to our purple sprouting broccoli, kalette, and a couple of other things.
Its designed to be tall so I can actually stand up in it though!

We're also growing larger areas of cabbages and cauliflowers this year, but their house is considerably smaller.

## Tomatoes
We're growing a lot of tomatoes this year, and I mean a lot...
16 different varieties to be exact.
We tend to go for the more unusual varieties, amusing names, and interesting colours.
from this years crop we'll work out what works well, what we like, and what we'll grow next year.

## Compost bins
Compost bins are a stple of pretty much every allotment, to say we're proud of ours is an understatement.
We've built them to last,
its reused wood from an old summer house with pallet-based storage at the back for bamboo canes.
Still needs to be painted but the hard work is mostly done there

## Climbing bean supports
This was today's other main job, get the supports ready for all the beans.
The uprights are 10' long (sunk down about 2 foot) and the cross-piece is 8' long and 7' up.
Its really sturdy and its one of the supports I really like to see build because its really the sign
that everything is about to start coming out of the greenhouses into the plot!

## Around the plot
There really is a lot going on at the plot at the moment,
but here are some other things that caught my eye as I was walking around taking pictures of today.
